# Jiksnu ("zheek snoo")

Jiksnu is a Lojban compound word (lujvo) for the words "Jikca
Casnu". This translates roughly to "is a social type of interaction"

## About Jiksnu

Jiksnu is a federated social network communicating over both HTTP and
XMPP. Currently, basic interop with Status.net servers is mostly
working. (Salmon support is not yet complete.) In addition, many other
standards-based applications work to some extent. The OneSocialWeb
protocol as well as other XEP-0277 XMPP-based servers are supported,
however, that code is out of date.

Buddycloud support is pending.

Jiksnu is built on top of the Ciste framework, and makes extensive use
of it's Action Routing framework and services.

## Features

* Realtime page updates
* XMPP notifications
* Federated user and domain discovery

## Thanks

I would like to thank the authors of the many great free software,
specifications and services from which I have used as libraries, used
as guides or reference implementations, or as inspiration. Without
their spirit of collaboration, none of this would ever have been
possible.
