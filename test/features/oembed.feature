Feature: oEmbed support
  In order to allow embedding of content
  As a oEmbed client
  I want to be aple to use the oEmbed specification

  # Scenario: An existing resource, unauthenticated
  #   Given I am not logged in
  #   And there is a public activity
  #   When I request the oembed resource for that activity
  #   Then I should receive an oEmbed document
