Feature: Feed Subscription Admin
  In order to manage feed subscriptions
  As an administrator
  I want to be able to perform basic operations on feed subscriptions

# Scenario: Index Feed Subscriptions, admin
#   Given I am logged in as an admin
#   And someone has subscribed to my feed
#   When I go to the "feed subscriptions admin index" page
#   Then I should see a list of feed-subscriptions
